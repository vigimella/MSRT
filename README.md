CI-CD Analysis


Once Dockerfile has started, the script contained allows filtering commit by file name or file extension, creating a CSV 
file, and cloning a repository in local storage using a CSV file as input where repositories are specified.

When is ended the cloning process, the repository is stored in the specific directory called "repos_dir".
